# stocks-ananlysis
## Overview of Project

Steve's parents want to know how actively DQ was traded in 2018. They believe that if a stock is traded often, then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock. If we sum up all of the daily volume for DQ, we'll have the yearly volume and a rough idea of how often it gets traded.But we don't want to calculate the numbers by hand, we want to have a more efficient way to do it. VBA is a quicker and more accuate way to do it once we set up the code right.So I helped him to set up the VBA code to calculate each stock's volumes and earnings back in 2017 and 2018. I also used VBA code formatting the results. Like make the cell of returns above 0 to be green and below 0 to be red. 

Steve loves the workbook I prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although my code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In this challenge, I edit, or refactor, the [Module 2 Challenge](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2638/assignments/45050?module_item_id=835412)solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that I did in this module. I will analysis the advantages and disadventages of refactoring the code. And describe my result about how efficent it is.

## Results
## Summary
There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general (3 pt).
There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).
